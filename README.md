Standard Kanban definitions for Kiket.

## Analytics assets

This template now ships dbt-powered analytics assets:

- `.kiket/analytics/dashboards/` – Flow health dashboards consumed by the app.
- `analytics/dbt/exposures/` – dbt exposure metadata referencing the shared marts so docs builds include the dashboard.

- `flow_health.yaml` – flow efficiency dashboard with cycle-time/throughput trends and usage activity table.
- Additional dashboards can be added alongside these files to extend the analytics surface for new projects.

Dashboards load automatically after a configuration sync. Ensure the analytics dbt pipeline has run so the tenant schemas (`analytics_org_*`) are populated before reviewing charts. Include the exposure folder when running `dbt docs generate` from this repo to publish dashboard metadata.
